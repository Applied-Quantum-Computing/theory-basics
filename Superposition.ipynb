Just as NOT blue is every color other than blue, NOT 0 is eveything other than 0. Since 0 or 1 are the only options, NOT 0 = 1 and NOT 1 = 0. If you don't believe me ask your computer with the code below."

    "Let's cut to the chase. The ability for a qubit to be 0 and 1 simultaneously is called superposition. Since the qubit can be \"positions\" 0 and 1 simultaneously, I guess physicists thought that was \"super.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a qubit in a superposition refers to any combination of probabilities 100-0, 50-50, 23.79-76.21. However, the most common meaning of \"superposition\" is a 50-50 split between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder, is the qubit **really** in 0 and 1 simultaneously or is something else going on? Short answer, the vast majority of physicists are very confident the qubit **really** is 0 and 1 at the same time. Long answer, take a quantum mechanics course and learn about Bell's inequalities and hidden local variables. As someone who regularly induces atoms into superpositions, I agree with the vast majority of physicists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note on superposition. **What does a superposition look like in real life?** It looks like initializing a qubit (could be an atom, superconducting circuit, photon, etc.) to 0 **or** 1, then manipulating it into a 50-50 superposition then measuring it. The measurement WILL ONLY RETURN A 0 **or** 1. To determine the superposition state of the qubit, many, many cycles of initialization, manipulation, and measurement are done. In the case of a 50-50 superposition. The detector would readout 0 and 1 each ~50% of the time."
