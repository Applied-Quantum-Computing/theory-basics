    "## Superposition\n",
    "The conclusion scientists (and you) have come to is that the usual OR logic is not enough to explain the two Hadamard gate behavior. The Hadamard gate must be outputting a state that follows AND logic. A cool word scientists invented for this state is <strong>superposition</strong>. After a Hadamard gate, we say the qubit is in a \"superposition of 0 and 1.\" You may have heard this state refered to as being 0 and 1, but this is wrong. To say the state is 0 and 1 implies 0 and 1 are not mutually exclusive, but by construction they are mutually exclusive; 0 is not-1 and 1 is not-0. It is a common (or lazy) enough mistake. Rather the superposition state the Hadamard gate output is a completely new state (i.e. the new word superposition) that follows completely new logic."

    "The ability for a qubit to be 0 and 1 simultaneously is called superposition. Since the qubit can be \"positions\" 0 and 1 simultaneously, I guess physicists thought that was \"super.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a qubit in a superposition refers to any combination of probabilities 100-0, 50-50, 23.79-76.21. However, the most common meaning of \"superposition\" is a 50-50 split between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder, is the qubit **really** in 0 and 1 simultaneously or is something else going on? Short answer, the vast majority of physicists are very confident the qubit **really** is 0 and 1 at the same time. Long answer, take a quantum mechanics course and learn about Bell's inequalities and hidden local variables. As someone who regularly induces atoms into superpositions, I agree with the vast majority of physicists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note on superposition. **What does a superposition look like in real life?** It looks like initializing a qubit (could be an atom, superconducting circuit, photon, etc.) to 0 **or** 1, then manipulating it into a 50-50 superposition then measuring it. The measurement WILL ONLY RETURN A 0 **or** 1. To determine the superposition state of the qubit, many, many cycles of initialization, manipulation, and measurement are done. In the case of a 50-50 superposition. The detector would readout 0 and 1 each ~50% of the time."
