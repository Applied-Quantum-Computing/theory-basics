    "# Theory Basics: the \"Quantum\" Behind Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for beginners! :D (Those who are interested in quantum computing but have not taken an college level quantum mechanics course.) I'll be real with you, this notebook dives into the **basic concepts** of quantum computing and not much application. Application will build off what you've learned here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, here are some prereqs that really are prerequisite to understanding the quantum behind quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "* familiar with python\n",
    "* familiar with matrices (linear algebra is the language of quantum computing)\n",
    "* familiar with jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* [prevision notebook](Information%20Encoding.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you meet these prereqs, great! :D If not, I doubt this notebook will be helpful to you. I **strongly** encourage you to learn those topics before going on. I'd suggest Khan academy for linear algebra—particularly eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",

    "### Qiskit\n",
    "To get started, you'll need to [install qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install). Qiskit is IBM's open source quantum computing python library. It has everything you need to make your own algorithms, execute well known algorithms, and run them on simulated or real quantum computers. There are other open source quantum computing libraries out there, but we'll just use qiskit for now. If you want to learn more about qiskit **definitely** go through their \"getting started\" [tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/1_start_here.ipynb)."

    "**The quantum behind quantum computing is the qubit**—plain and simple.

    "# The Qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit is a quantum bit. (Get it? quantum bit -> qubit? Physics jokes...) A qubit can be 0 or 1—much like it's classical companion. However, what distinguishes a qubit from a bit, is the **quantum** part. The quantum part of a qubit allows it to have a **probability** of being in 0 **and** 1 simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's highlight the difference between a bit and a qubit a little more. A classical bit is **always** 100% 0 **or** 1, but a qubit can be 55% 0 and 45% 1. A qubit can have any probability of being 0 than 1 as long as those probabilities **always** add to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use to math to illustrate. A very convention notation to use is Dirac notation. It uses a \"ket\" $| x \\rangle$ (or \"bra\" $\\langle x|$) to represent a qubit state. For example, a qubit 100% in the 0 state would be $|x\\rangle = |0\\rangle$. In general, we could say\n",

    "where $\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = 1$. Note the probability of being 0 or 1 is the **square** of the coefficient. A 1/3 chance of 0 and 2/3 chance of 1 would look like $|x\\rangle = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{3}}|1\\rangle$"

    "# Information Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The second fundamental part of computing is processing, or manipulating, information. There are two ways of doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analog model\n",
    "The analog model is what many research laboratories use in studying quantum materials and quantum mechanics. It's not what people typically mean when they refer to quantum computing, so I won't discuss it further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gate model\n",
    "The gate model uses \"gates\" to manipulate qubits and execute algorithms. Every quantum computer group uses this model because it allows for \"universal\" computing, which simply means you can compute anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gate takes in one or more qubits, modifies them, then spits them out. It's less like an actual fence or wall gate and more like a small factory or function, taking something in, modifying it, and spitting it back out.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of gates. Ones that act on single qubits (single-qubit gates) and those that act on two qubits (two-qubit gates). Three-qubit gates and higher exist, but those higher number gates can always be decomposed back into single- and two-qubit gates. Since single- and two-qubit gates are the most fundamental, they are what most (if not all) people use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my view, there is functionally only one single-qubit gate."
